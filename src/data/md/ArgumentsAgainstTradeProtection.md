## Misallocation of Resources

> **&#9432; Note:**  
> A misallocation of resources occurs when resources are not allocated in the best way.

Protectionism creates a misallocation of resources as they can distort prices. Tariffs and quotas increase the price of imported goods while subsidies decrease the price of domestic goods. Since price alters how much good is demanded, the distortion of prices will lead to misallocation of resources.

## Retaliation

If one country implements a trade protection, its trading partner may do the same in retaliation. Often, this may continue escalating, leading to a trade war. A trade war will cause tension between countries and worsen public relationships.

## Increased Costs

> **&#9432; Note:**  
> A downstream industry uses inputs to production that are intermediate goods. For example, furniture is a downstream industry from the timber industry.

The cost of production will increase if tariffs or quotas are imposed on raw materials. When implementing a tariff or quota, the government should be mindful of the effects on downstream industries.

## Higher Prices

Similar to what was explained in the **Increased Costs** section, the implementation of tariffs and quotas will lead to higher prices, especially for domestic consumers. A tariff acts like a tax that increases the price of goods, while a quota creates a shortage in the market that puts upward pressure on prices.

## Less Choice

The implementation of trade protections will likely limit the amount of goods imported into a country. This will cause the market to have a limited amount of choices mostly provided by domestic producers.

## Lack of Incentives for Domestic Firms to Become More Efficient

Without foreign competition, domestic firms have no incentive to be more efficient. Competition pushes firms to employ the cheapest and best method of production, where innovation and investment in research and development occur. However, without competition, this pressure will not exist.

## Reduced Export Competitiveness

Protectionism creates a higher-cost environment, which reduces the efficiency of firms in the domestic market. This means that the export competitiveness of the country will be affected.
