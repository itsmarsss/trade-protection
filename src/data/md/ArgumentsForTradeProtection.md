## Protection of Infant (Sunrise) Industries

> **&#9432; Note:**  
> An infant industry (or sunrise industry) is one that has just opened up and is not yet large enough to take advantage of economies of scale.

Governments can support infant industries by employing administrative barriers such as product standards. This will help slow (possibly stop entirely) the import of goods. This allows for the domestic company to catch up in terms of size in the industry so it can begin to take advantage of economies of scale and compete with imported goods.

## National Security

Some goods and services are preferred to be produced domestically due to national security concerns. A major consideration is the defense industry, it is unwise for a government to heavily rely on importing military equipment.

In 2024, the USA remains the largest military equipment dealer,

## Maintenance of Health and Safety

To keep the citizens of a country safe, governments must enforce health and safety laws on goods or services. If a good poses threats to consumer health and safety, a government will likely impose trade protection to either minimize or completely remove the good from circulation.

## Environmental Standard

Similar to the **Maintenance of Health** and Safety of citizens, the environment is also just as important. If a good does not comply with environmental standards, the government will impose trade protection to either minimize or completely remove the good from circulation.

## Anti-Dumping

Dumping refers to foreign firms pricing their goods below production cost when exporting. This is a type of predatory pricing behavior when done abroad. An importer may "dump" goods abroad to dominate in a new market. This practice is deemed illegal by the WTO, and countries can avoid this by implementing protectionist measures to protect domestic industries.

## Unfair Competition

> **&#9432; Note:**  
> A patent gives a firm the sole right to exclude others from producing an identical or similar good. It provides firms with the time required to earn substantial profits in exchange for taking the risk of investing a lot of money in the research and development stage.

Governments can protect domestic innovators and inventors by using patents. This can help prevent the importation of goods identical to the ones produced locally. If a country lacks the infrastructure to enforce international patent laws, foreign firms can reverse engineer goods produced by domestic firms.

## Balance-of-Payments Correction

Ideally, imports should equal exports, achieving a total balance of payments equal to zero. However, sometimes a trade deficit may occur, where imports outweigh exports. Governments can implement protectionist policies to slow or stop imports to prevent an outflow of funds.

## Sources of Government Revenue

If a government implements a tariff on an imported good, it can provide revenue to the government. This revenue can then be redirected towards the industry as subsidies or other public benefits.

## Protection of Jobs

Domestic firms may not be as competent enough to compete with foreign firms. This will often lead to domestic firms laying off employees as demand for domestic-produced goods drops. The government can alleviate this by implementing trade protection that boosts the demand for domestically produced goods.

## Economically Least Developed Country (ELDC) Diversification

> **&#9432; Note:**  
> An industrial base refers to the broad production capabilities of a nation in key industries.

Economically least developed countries (ELDCs) can protect key industries in the short run. Competition can be eliminated through the use of trade protection, the absence of competition allows the domestic industry to have a chance to grow and flourish.
