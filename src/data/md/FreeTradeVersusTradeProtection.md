## Free Trade:

### Free Trade Pros:

> **&#9432; Note:**  
> World output: The sum of the GDP for every nation on the planet. In 2019, world GDP was around 80 trillion USD.
>
> Economic growth is when a country produces more goods and services in one period than in a previous one. It is usually measured by changes in the real GDP.

Free trade allows each country to specialize in producing the goods that they have a comparative advantage in. This will help increase overall world output and efficiency. It promotes economic growth by maximizing production efficiency and facilitating access to a larger selection of goods and services.

### Free Trade Cons:

> **&#9432; Note:**  
> The terms of trade measures a countryâ€™s export prices in relation to its import prices

Although free trade appears to be beneficial to all involved, the pros are not completely shared equally. The terms of trade heavily influence which countries benefit. Subsidies and larger economies can disadvantage smaller producers, leading to unequal gains from trade and potential exploitation.

### Free Trade Others:

It is widely argued that free trade offers the potential for economic growth through specialization and increased efficiency, but is also known for unequal benefits and exploitation.

## Trade Protection:

### Trade Protection Pros:

Trade protections like tariffs can protect domestic firms from foreign competition, possibly leading to increased output and more economic growth. Tariffs can make imports more expensive, which boosts domestic production, especially in industries with larger economies of scale.

### Trade Protection Cons:

However, trade protections can prevent competition and innovation, leading to greater inefficiencies and higher costs in the protected industries. It may also cause retaliation from trading partners, which disrupts global trade and can harm domestic consumers by causing higher prices and reduced choices.

### Trade Protection Others:

It is argued that protectionism can offer short-term benefits to specific industries, but its long-term effects on economic growth are debatable due to possible inefficiencies and the risk of trade wars.

## Additional Considerations:

### International Mindedness:

As mentioned earlier, governments should consider the effects of protectionist policies on the global trading scene. Protectionism can affect global relations and lead to retaliatory measures from trading partners. Although trade protections offer short-term benefits to domestic industries, they could lead to long-term inefficiencies and trade disruptions.

### Resource Allocation:

> **&#9432; Note:**  
> Corruption creates a misallocation of resources. Corruption interferes with market forces, and allocates resources unfairly. A government might be corrupt by purposefully overpaying for government infrastructure projects.

Additionally, protectionism can decrease efficient resource allocation, possibly diverting resources away from a country's industries with comparative advantage, also known as corruption. This misallocation can hinder economic growth by reducing investments in likely more productive industries and increasing costs for downstream industries.
